# CoderDojo Banbridge - Project Submission System

## Overview
A secure, mentor-approved project submission system that allows CoderDojo members to showcase their work while maintaining content safety and quality control.

## Project Goals
- Enable young coders to easily submit their projects for showcase

2. **Track Status**
   - Visit status page with submission ID
   - Receive email notifications on status changes
   - No account creation required

3. **Project Goes Live**
   - Once approved, project appears on main website
   - Celebration email sent to submitter

### For Mentors (Reviewers)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend Forms and Status Page
- [ ] Create upload form with validation
- [ ] Build status checking page
- [ ] Implement file upload handling
- [ ] Add form submission feedback

### Phase 2: Static Backend (Testing)
- [ ] Create mock status API responses
- [ ] Test form submission flow
- [ ] Validate email notifications locally
- [ ] Test file upload and validation

### Phase 3: Cloudflare Worker API
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Worker
- [ ] Implement form processing endpoint
- [ ] Add file validation and storage
- [ ] Create GitHub API integration

### Phase 4: GitHub Integration
- [ ] Automated PR creation
- [ ] Project data file updates
- [ ] Image file management
- [ ] Merge detection for status updates

### Phase 5: Notification System
- [ ] Email service integration
- [ ] Mentor notification system
- [ ] Status update emails
- [ ] Error handling and logging

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- File type restrictions (images only)
- File size limits (max 5MB)
- Content filtering for inappropriate language
- Email validation
- URL validation for project links

### Content Safety
- All submissions require mentor approval
- No direct file uploads to main site
- PR-based review allows for discussion
- Easy rollback via Git history

### Spam Prevention
- Rate limiting on submissions
- Basic CAPTCHA or similar verification
- Email verification for status updates
- Monitoring for duplicate submissions

## File Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ upload.html              # Project submission form
â”œâ”€â”€ status.html              # Status checking page
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/

## Environment Variables (Cloudflare Worker)
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_REPO=Ninjadawg101/CDBW-copy
EMAIL_API_KEY=key_xxxxxxxxxxxx

```

## Cost Estimates
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Free tier (100k requests/day)
- **GitHub API**: Free (public repository)
- **Email Service**: ~$5-10/month for transactional emails

- Time from submission to approval
- Student engagement and repeat submissions
- Mentor review workload and efficiency
- Website traffic to projects section

## Future Enhancements
